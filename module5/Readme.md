## 📋 Module Overview

- **Evaluation and Logging**: Measure and monitor RAG system performance  
- **System Optimization**: Balance cost, speed, and quality tradeoffs  
- **Multi-modal RAG**: Incorporate images, PDFs, and other modalities  
- **Programming Assignment**: Apply all skills in a hands-on project

---

## 🚧 Production Challenges

- **Scaling Performance**: Increased traffic raises latency, memory, and compute costs  
- **Unpredictable Prompts**: Hard to anticipate every user query (e.g., “How many rocks should I eat?”)  
- **Messy Real-World Data**: Fragmented formats, missing metadata, non-text sources  
- **Security & Privacy**: Protect proprietary data and enforce authorized access

---

## 📈 Evaluation & Logging

### Key Metrics

- **Software Performance**: Latency, throughput, memory, token usage  
- **Quality Metrics**: Human feedback, LLM-as-judge for context relevance and citation accuracy  

### Tracking Strategies

- **Aggregate Statistics**: Identify trends and regressions over time  
- **Detailed Logs/Traces**: Follow individual prompts through the RAG pipeline  
- **Experimentation**: A/B testing new system settings and prompts

## 🛠️ System Optimization Techniques

- **Component vs System Scope**: Measure end-to-end vs per-component latencies  
- **Code-based Evaluators**: Automate performance checks and JSON validation  
- **Human Feedback & LLM-as-Judge**: Balance cost vs flexibility for quality evaluation  
- **Iterative Improvement**: Observe traffic → Evaluate performance → Experiment → Repeat

## ⚙️ Advanced Techniques

### Quantization

- **Vector & LLM Quantization**: Reduce parameter bit-width (e.g., 16→8‑bit) for memory and speed gains  
- **Matryoshka Quantization**: Order dimensions by importance for flexible retrieval  

### Caching

- **Direct Caching**: Return cached responses for high-similarity prompts  
- **Personalized Caching**: Use a small LLM to adjust cached responses  

### Retrieval Latency

- **Quantized Embeddings**: Lower-bit vectors for faster searches  
- **Database Sharding & Provider Tools**: Distribute indexes and leverage platform features  

---

## 💰 Cost vs Quality Tradeoffs

- **LLM Costs**: Choose smaller or quantized models; optimize prompt length  
- **Vector DB Costs**: Use tiered storage (RAM, SSD, object storage); multi-tenancy and on-demand loading  
- **Latency vs Quality**: Tailor pipeline (router LLM, skip unnecessary components) to balance speed and response fidelity

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Knowledge Base Separation**: Per-tenant databases or metadata filters  
- **Encryption**: Store vectors decrypted for ANN; optionally encrypt text chunks  
- **Mitigations**: Add noise to vectors, reduce dimensionality to prevent reconstruction  

---

## 🖼️ Multi-Modal & PDF RAG

- **Multi-Modal Models**: Unified text-image transformers; embedding of both modalities  
- **PDF RAG**: Split slides/PDFs into patches, vectorize patches, and score like ColBERT  
- **Benefits**: Flexible retrieval of charts, images, and text; high performance on dense formats

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Production RAG demands observability, evaluation, security, and cost control  
- Advanced optimizations (quantization, caching, sharding) are essential at scale  
- Multi-modal support unlocks richer knowledge sources (slides, images, audio/video)
